      "question": "Is beta pricing really locked in forever?",
      "answer": "Yes. Like YouTube Premium early adopters who still pay $7.99 while new users pay $13.99 (10 years later), your $2.99/mo rate never changes. Ever."
    },
    "why": {
      "question": "Why pay when the official clipper is free?",
      "answer": "If the official clipper works for you, stick with it. We built this for people who experience \"go online\" errors and need offline support. Different problem, different solution."
