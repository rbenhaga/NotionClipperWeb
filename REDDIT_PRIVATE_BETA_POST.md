## 📝 Reddit Post Template

### Titre (choisir 1):
1. **"Built a Notion clipper that works offline - need 50 beta testers"**
2. **"Tired of 'go online' errors? Built an offline-first Notion clipper [Beta]"**
3. **"I built a Notion clipper with offline mode - looking for beta testers"**

### Post Body:

```markdown
Hey r/Notion,

I'm a French economics student who's been frustrated with existing Notion clippers 
constantly showing "go online" errors. So I built an offline-first clipper.

**What works now:**
- ✅ Chrome extension (functional but buggy)
- ✅ Offline queue (clips sync when you're back online)
- ✅ OAuth Google + Notion
- ✅ Basic clipboard capture

**What's still broken:**
- ⚠️ Desktop app (macOS in private testing)
- ⚠️ Some edge cases in markdown parsing
- ⚠️ UI needs polish

**I need 50 beta testers who:**
- Use Notion daily
- Work offline sometimes (trains, planes, cafes with bad wifi)
- Are willing to report bugs (weekly feedback survey)
- Clip web content regularly

**In exchange:**
- Free PRO forever (no payment ever)
- Shape the product roadmap
- Early access to all features

**Not ready for:**
- Critical work (it's a beta, bugs exist)
- People who need 100% stability
- Those who prefer polished products

Being honest: This is rough around the edges. But if you've ever lost a clip 
because of "go online" errors, this solves that problem TODAY.

Interested? Comment or DM me.

## ⚠️ Common Questions (Prepare Answers)

**Q: "Is this free?"**
A: Yes, for beta testers. Free PRO forever, no payment ever.

**Q: "When will it be stable?"**
A: Aiming for v1.0 in 3-4 months. But core offline feature works TODAY.

**Q: "How is this different from [competitor]?"**
A: We're the only one with true offline mode. Others require constant internet.

**Q: "Can I trust you with my Notion data?"**
A: We use Notion's official OAuth. We never store your Notion content, only metadata.

**Q: "What if you shut down?"**
A: Your data stays in Notion. We don't lock you in. If we shut down, 60 days notice + refunds.

**Q: "Why should I beta test?"**
A: If you've ever lost a clip due to "go online" errors, this solves that. Plus free PRO forever.
